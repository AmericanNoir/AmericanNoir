- 👋 Hi, I’m @AmericanNoir a noob to all coding. 
- 👀 I’m interested in Homebridge/HomeKit 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AutoCad which has little to do here. My C++ and Java aren't very good. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really I just want to learn and understand how things work. 
- 📫 How to reach me here for now until I figure out how this place works.
